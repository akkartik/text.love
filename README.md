# An editor for plain text.

Not very useful by itself, but it's a fork of [lines.love](http://akkartik.name/lines.html)
that you can take in other directions besides line drawings, while easily
sharing patches between forks.

Designed above all to be easy to modify and give you early warning if your
modifications break something.

## Invocation

To run from the terminal, [pass this directory to LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Running_Games),
optionally with a file path to edit.

Alternatively, turn it into a .love file you can double-click on:
```
$ zip -r /tmp/text.love *.lua
```

By default, it reads/writes the file `lines.txt` in your default
user/home directory (`https://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem.getUserDirectory`).

To open a different file, drop it on the app window.

## Keyboard shortcuts

While editing text:
* `ctrl+f` to find patterns within a file
* `ctrl+c` to copy, `ctrl+x` to cut, `ctrl+v` to paste
* `ctrl+z` to undo, `ctrl+y` to redo
* `ctrl+=` to zoom in, `ctrl+-` to zoom out, `ctrl+0` to reset zoom
* `alt+right`/`alt+left` to jump to the next/previous word, respectively
* mouse drag or `shift` + movement to select text, `ctrl+a` to select all
* `ctrl+e` to modify the sources

Exclusively tested so far with a US keyboard layout. If
you use a different layout, please let me know if things worked, or if you
found anything amiss: http://akkartik.name/contact

## Known issues

* No support yet for Unicode graphemes spanning multiple codepoints.

* No support yet for right-to-left languages.

* Undo/redo may be sluggish in large files. Large files may grow sluggish in
  other ways. Works well in all circumstances with files under 50KB.

* If you kill the process, say by force-quitting because things things get
  sluggish, you can lose data.

* Long wrapping lines can't yet distinguish between the cursor at end of one
  screen line and start of the next, so clicking the mouse to position the
  cursor can very occasionally do the wrong thing.

* Can't scroll while selecting text with mouse.

* No scrollbars yet. That stuff is hard.

* When editing sources, selecting text is not yet completely implemented.

## Mirrors and Forks

This repo is a fork of [lines.love](http://akkartik.name/lines.html).
Updates to it can be downloaded from the following mirrors:

* https://codeberg.org/akkartik/text.love

Further forks are encouraged. If you show me your fork, I'll link to it here.

* https://codeberg.org/akkartik/view.love -- a stripped down version without
  support for modifying files; useful starting point for some forks.
* https://codeberg.org/akkartik/pong.love -- a fairly minimal example app that
  can edit and debug its own source code.
* https://codeberg.org/akkartik/template-live-editor.love -- a template for
  building "free-wheeling" live programs (easy to fork, can be modified as
  they run), with a text editor primitive.
* https://codeberg.org/akkartik/luaML.love -- a free-wheeling 'browser' for a
  Lua-based markup language built as a live program.
* https://codeberg.org/akkartik/driver.love -- a programming environment for
  modifying free-wheeling programs while they run.
